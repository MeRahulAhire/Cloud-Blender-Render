Based on the Server Side Public License v1 (© MongoDB, Inc., 2018)
Modified and extended under Section 7 (Additional Terms)

=====================================================================
ADDITIONAL TERMS — Cloud Blender Render Modification
=====================================================================

1. Authorized Template Uploads
------------------------------
Only Rahul Ahire, the original author of Cloud Blender Render, is permitted to:
- Upload, publish, or list Cloud Blender Render (or modified versions) as a 
  public or shared template on any GPU hosting or software-as-a-service 
  platform, including but not limited to Runpod, Vast.ai, Paperspace, AWS, 
  Azure, or Google Cloud.
- Use the name Cloud Blender Render, CBR, or any derivative as an official 
  template or public image name.

Other individuals or entities may not publish this software as a community or 
official template on such platforms without explicit written consent from 
the copyright holder.


2. Platform Revenue Sharing Requirement
---------------------------------------
If a cloud, GPU, or hosting platform uses Cloud Blender Render (or a modified 
version thereof) to provide rendering or compute services to paying users:
- The platform must share a fair revenue percentage with the copyright holder 
  (Rahul Ahire) as compensation for use of the software as part of a commercial offering.
- The platform may not retain 100% of revenues generated by the hosted instances.
- “Fair revenue” is defined as a minimum of 10% of net usage revenue per hosted 
  instance, unless otherwise negotiated in writing.

Failure to comply constitutes a breach of this License, immediately terminating 
all rights granted under it.


3. Platform Neutrality and Fair Access
--------------------------------------
A platform hosting Cloud Blender Render:
- May not publish or maintain its own “official” or competing template that 
  replaces or deprioritizes the author’s version.
- May not remove or restrict the author’s official template while allowing 
  others to host competing derivatives.
- Must treat all legitimate user templates equally, subject to community guidelines.


4. Individuals and Non-Commercial Use
-------------------------------------
These additional restrictions do not apply to:
- Individual users running Cloud Blender Render for personal, educational, or 
  non-commercial projects.
- Independent creators or studios using it for their own rendering needs, as long 
  as they are not reselling hosting access or operating it as a public rendering service.


5. Service Hosting and Source Code Obligations
----------------------------------------------
If you make Cloud Blender Render or a modified version available to others as a 
service (e.g., network rendering, SaaS, or platform integration), you must:
- Comply with Section 13 (“Offering the Program as a Service”) of the SSPL, and
- Make available the full Service Source Code, including any management, orchestration, 
  or monetization code used to provide such service.


6. Trademark and Branding
-------------------------
“Cloud Blender Render”, “CBR”, and associated logos or branding are trademarks of Rahul Ahire.
Use of these marks is permitted only to refer to the original software or for fair descriptive use.
No right or license is granted under trademark law by this License.


=====================================================================
SUMMARY OF INTENT (Non-Binding)
=====================================================================
This modified SSPL aims to:
- Keep Cloud Blender Render source code publicly available.
- Encourage fair use and contribution from individuals.
- Prevent exploitation by GPU/hosting platforms who profit from the software 
  without contributing back.
- Preserve authorship and ecosystem neutrality.

All other terms of the Server Side Public License (SSPL v1) remain in full effect.


=====================================================================
BASE LICENSE — SERVER SIDE PUBLIC LICENSE v1
=====================================================================

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

    “This License” refers to the Server Side Public License.

    “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
    such as semiconductor masks.

    “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
    Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be
    individuals or organizations.

    To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
    fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
    The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work
    “based on” the earlier work.

    A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

    To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would
    make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
    copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
    Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
    making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

    To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
    make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
    with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

    An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent
    that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays
    an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
    for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
    may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
    If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a
    prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
