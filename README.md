# Cloud Blender Render

### Introduction 
With the rise of AI/LLM boom Jensen's leather jacket is getting shinier with each passing years. What that has resulted into is GPU's getting crazy expensive for regular consumers and especially the 3D artist using blender who heavily rely on Nvidia GPUs. Being a web developer and the user of blender I created this project which allows you to run this docker container on various GPU cloud providers like Runpod, vast.ai, Quickpod, etc to render your `.blend` files with powerful GPU like RTX 4090, RTX 5090 and many more at dirt cheap rates.

This project allows you to access 3000+ USD GPU for under a 1 USD/hour meaning you can render 500-1000 frame with single dollar and that's significantly cheaper than legacy render farms and comes with beautiful GUI to make it feel naturally intuitive for Blender user.

### Requirement
This project will only run on Chrome or Chromium based browsers like Chrome, Edge, Opera, Chromium, Vivaldi, etc. This project utilise [`showDirectoryPicker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showDirectoryPicker) API which allows user to write files directly on their folder without needing to download a large zip or many files. If you're using Firefox or Safari as your dialy driver and want to use this project, please considering downloading Chrome or any Chromium based browser as Firefox and Safari doesn't properly support this functionality.
